1,Annie,"Brand, Orianna, Morgana","Ahri, Fizz, Akali","Mid, Bottom","Mage, Support",Stay away from her when she has her stun ready.,"Annie's strength as a mage comes from her decent laning phase with Disintegrate allowing her to last-hit without mana problems, and her exceptional AoE damage potential from Incinerate and Summon: Tibbers."
2,Olaf,"Kennen, Kayle, Volibear","Irelia, Riven, Shyvana","Top, Jungle","Tank, Fighter","Don't blow your CC abilities when Olaf activates his ultimate, as he can't be disabled during the duration.","Because of Berserker Rage's effect and Undertow, Olaf is one of the fastest junglers in the league. Undertow allows him to gank effectively, and the combination of Vicious Strikes and Berserker Ragelet him both sustain his health throughout the early game and effectively take on and defeat most other junglers."
3,Galio,"Udyr, Talon, Yasuo","LeBlanc, Cassiopeia, Brand","Mid, Top","Tank, Mage",Don't clump together so Galio won't be able to use Flash and his ultimate to CC your whole team.,"Galio is a tanky mage focused on dealing great AoE damage. His kit is oriented to constantly cast his spells to create an opportunity for an initiation. Despite being a tank, Galio is generally played in the mid lane, building magic resistance against the enemy mage. He can also be played top lane in a standard tank role or bot lane as a tanky support."
4,Twisted Fate,"Fizz, Diana, Ahri","Ryze, Lissandra, Evelynn","Mid, Bottom",Mage,Twisted Fate is vulnerable when his Pick-a-card is on cooldown.,"Due to Wild Cards having one of the highest non-global non-ultimate range in-game, he can harass very well. This makes him a good pick for mid lane. While the projectiles are slow moving, the long range of the cards often catch enemies by surprise. Additionally, the projectiles, unlike many skillshots and pokes, will pass through minions, and even do damage as multiple targets are passed. This disallows opponents from blocking with their waves."
5,Xin Zhao,"Jax, Malphite, Patheon","Vladimir, Jayce, Rumble","Top, Jungle","Fighter, Tank, Assassin",Prevent him from finishing his Three Talon Strikes to deny him a knock-up as well as a cooldown reduction on his abilities.,"Battle Cry's passive heals Xin Zhao every three attacks, allowing him to sustain himself in lane for a while by autoattacking minion waves and turrets. Doing so for extended periods however will push your lane, so watch out for gank attempts."
6,Urgot,"Soraka, Sivir, Nami","Graves, Vayne, Corki","Mid, Top, Bottom","Marksman, Tank",Destroying Urgot's shield will prevent him from applying a slow to his auto attacks and Acid Hunters.,Zaun-Touched Bolt Augmenter is a strong debuff that can save your team from a lot of damage. Apply it liberally to enemy champions when fighting.
7,LeBlanc,"Galio, Diana, Mordekaiser","Ahri, Ziggs, Orianna",Mid,"Assassin, Mage",Buying a Banshee's Veil will significantly cut her damage down!,"Distortion is an effective method of harassment, as re-casting the spell will cause you to flash back to your casting position, giving an opportunity to deal damage with minimal risk of taking significant damage."
8,Vladimir,"Swain, Riven, Irelia","Singed, Shen, Nasus","Top, Mid","Tank, Mage",Vladimir's ultimate can be cured by buying a Quicksilver Sash.,"Level Transfusion to level 5, as it is Vladimir's most constant single target damage ability, as well as his heal. Remember that the base healing component is a flat amount modified by additional ability power, so even if the target is not damaged (i.e. shielded, blocked by Banshee's Veil, or blocked by Kayle's Intervention), you will still be healed by the ability."
9,Fiddlesticks,"Xin Zhao, Diana, Alistar","Katarina, Vladimir, Akali",Jungle,Mage,Using a stun/knock-up/displacement/silence when Fiddlesticks is channeling his ultimate/Drain will stop him completely.,"Fiddlesticks is versatile and can go on a variety of lanes, with the most common one being jungle. Due to Fiddlestick's sustain with Drain, he is one of the few junglers who don't have to worry at all with being at such low HP at the first clear, that they have to go back to base instead of ganking. In fact, this combined with Terrify makes Fiddlesticks one of the best level 1-3 gankers; he can even gank at level 2 just after taking blue if he decides to level up Terrify instead of Dark Wind."
10,Kayle,"Patheon, Anivia, Annie","Zed, Darius, Fizz","Mid, Top","Fighter, Support","A target that's ulted by Kayle can still be CC'd, so you can still trap them until the Intervention duration wears off.","Reckoning is powerful even at lower levels and Kayle can utilize this advantageous ability to dominate her opponents in early game; caution should be taken in its use, however, as it is a mana-costly spell to use repeatedly."
11,Master Yi,"Jax, Teemo, Rammus","Lux, Ashe, Karthus","Jungle, Top",Assassin,"Although Master Yi cannot be slowed during his ultimate, he can still be disabled.","Master Yi is a DPS-based champion that relies more on his auto attacks for damage through extra attack speed and only occasional use of his abilities which tend to be more for personal utility. Because of his ease of usage with high damage DPS, he is rather infamous due to being hard to duel against, his Alpha Strike being a powerful invincible execute to low health targets, and his Highlander providing resets on his ability cooldowns without him missing a beat as he slays his enemies."
12,Alistar,"Janna, Vayne, Lulu","Blitzcrank, Leona, Thresh","Jungle, Bottom","Tank, Support",Don't stand too close to enemy tower when pushing so that Alistar won't be able to use Flash pulverize into headbutt combo.,"The most important thing a new Alistar should learn is the WQ combo. You should master it, as there is nothing more annoying than chasing an enemy and your Alistar knock him away. The trick is: just as the Headbutt animation starts (once you start moving towards an enemy), press and hold Pulverize. Don't let go of it, because once the headbutt ends, Pulverize will automatically trigger."
13,Ryze,"Cassiopeia, Xerath, Twisted Fate","Fizz, Renekton, Veigar","Mid, Top",Mage,"Ryze can outduel almost anyone in the game. Unless you're at a clear advantage, avoid fighting him 1v1.",Don't be afraid to use Overload to last hit minions as the spell has low cooldown and low mana cost.
14,Sion,"Morgana, Garen, Riven","Nasus, Tryndamere, Aatrox","Top, Jungle",Tank,"Try to burst down Sion's shield - this will prevent the shield from dealing any damage, cutting his damage down in half.","Sion relies heavily on good skill timing and placement in order to be useful - his whole kit (excepting Soul Furnace's shield) is relatively unreliable to use. But when he can work well together with his team or just outplay the opponent, Sion is a devastating force in team fights."
15,Sivir,"Vayne, Draven, Twitch","Caitlyn, Jinx, Graves",Bottom,Marksman,"Try to wait a split second longer before trading with her, as a lot of Sivir players will turn on their Spell Shield pre-emptively.","During the laning phase, you can harass enemy champions with Boomerang Blade to put pressure on them. Successful hits will force them to play safer and get zoned out. However, the mana cost of this playstyle is extremely high, due to Sivir's small mana pool."
16,Soraka,"Miss Fortune, Blitzcrank, Tristana","Karthus, Yasuo, Urgot","Bottom, Mid","Support, Mage",Always keep in mind that Soraka is able to cure all her allies in an instant. Don't get baited by this!,"Soraka's a support who works best in the immediately proximity of her marksman. Here she can keep her lane partner healthy with Astral Infusion before turning to Starcall to damage the enemy bot lane champions and restore some of her own health. Equinox has serious potential to win trades, too â€“ casting it beneath an enemy AD caster ( Graves and Varus, for example) greatly reduces their damage output, while using it beneath the enemy support cuts off their ability to use their array of abilities and summoner spells."
17,Teemo,"Yorick, Pantheon, Jayce","Darius, Nasus, Garen","Top, Bottom","Fighter, Marksman",Avoid fighting a Teemo if you're an auto-attack based champion. His blind will mess you up.,Sometimes it is better to stand still and go into Camouflage for an escape mechanism than to use Move Quick or Recall.
18,Tristana,"Corki, Draven, Lucian","Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, Vayne",Bottom,Marksman,Avoid standing near low health creeps to not take additional damage from Tristana's Explosive shots.,"Draw a Bead becomes extremely powerful later in the game, allowing Tristana to hit enemies from a greater distance than most."
19,Warwick,"Yorick, Udyr, Olaf","Cho'Gath, Shen, Malphite","Jungle, Top","Fighter, Tank",A Quicksilver Sash and will stop Warwick's ultimate immediately.,"Warwick's strength comes from his incredible sustain and durability in both the lane and jungle with his Eternal Thirst and Hungering Strike along with his ability to support his team with Hunter's Call and lockdown high priority targets with Infinite Duress. However, he lacks hard burst and is reliant on his teammates to follow up with him."
20,Nunu,"Cassiopeia, Sona, Soraka","Yorick, Heimerdinger, Jax","Jungle, Top, Mid, Bottom","Support, Mage, Assassin, Fighter",It's imperative to disable (silence/stun/knock-up/displacement) him when he starts channeling his ultimate - otherwise you will take tons of damage.,"Utilizing Visionary can enable Nunu to constantly harass with Ice Blast and heal with Consume. Blood Boil can also be utilized to trigger Visionary more often, especially if laning with a friendly ranged champion like Ashe or Tristana."
21,Miss Fortune,"Tristana, Draven, Caitlyn","Ezreal, Vayne, Graves",Bottom,Marksman,Miss Fortune is very vulnerable when she is channeling her ultimate. Either focus her or disable (stun/silence/knock-up/displacement) her.,"Miss Fortune ramps up movement speed with her passive Strut if she isn't attacked by an enemy unit. Avoid getting hit to keep her passive. This is an exceptional passive when it comes to reaching lanes or closing distances fast, such as crossing lanes to support or gank."
22,Ashe,"Ezreal, Graves, Caitlyn","Vayne, Udyr, Jinx",Bottom,Marksman,"Play aggressively in lane against her, because her Volley has a really long cooldown at earlier levels.","When facing melee champions, it is highly advisable for Ashe to 'kite' her opponents via her Frost Shot."
23,Tryndamere,"Teemo, Jax, Renekton","Aatrox, Riven, Master Yi","Top, Jungle",Fighter,Armor items such as Thornmail and Randuin's Omen do extremely well against Tryndamere because he is completely auto-attack based.,"Bloodlust is Tryndamere's first and most important ability. Not only does it increase your lane sustainability, but gives you more attack damage plus a bonus in accordance to your missing health. In short, the less health Tryndamere has, the more damage he deals."
24,Jax,"Malphite, Renekton, Garen","Yasuo, Aatrox, Fiora","Top, Jungle","Fighter, Tank",Avoid attacking him when he turns on his Counter Strike.,"When laning, Jax is an excellent zoner when in the brush, because his Leap Strike - Empower combo enables heavy harassment with a lot of pressure. Be careful as these two abilities drain a lot of mana."
25,Morgana,"Talon, Katarina, Vladimir","Leona, Braum, Blitzcrank","Bottom, Mid","Support, Mage",A Quicksilver Sash will get rid of Morgana's ultimate chains.,"Morgana is considered to be strong in two roles; as an AP caster at mid lane, or as a disengage and poke-based support."
26,Zilean,"Morgana, Annie, Karma","Zac, Darius, Zed","Bottom, Mid","Support, Mage","Be careful of his level 2 all-ins, as he has one of the strongest level 2 bursts in the game.","Placing Time Bomb on allied initiators such as Malphite, Hecarim, and Amumu as they are about to initiate on multiple enemies is a good way to help rack up burst damage. Using Time Bombs on Evelynn, Shaco, Rengar, KhaZix, Talon, Wukong, or Twitch can lead to a heavy unexpected nuke to the enemy team, thanks to these characters' ability to stealth."
27,Singed,"Teemo, Vladimir, Jayce","Jax, Zed, Fiora",Top,Tank,"Do not chase singed, as his poison will continuously reset against you.","Poison Trail is very effective for farming and harassing, allowing Singed to dominate his lane. Poisoning the opposing minions as they advance is an effective strategy for farming lanes."
28,Evelynn,"Ryze, Kassadin, Cassiopeia","Fiddlesticks, Amumu, Sejuani",Jungle,Assassin,Evelynn is vulnerable to slows after she uses her Dark Frenzy.,"Evelynn is an effective roamer. Use Shadow Walk to scout out and surprise enemy champions that overextend and possibly get a kill. This is most effective early game. By roaming, this allows your solo laner to farm minions while keeping the enemy solo back and losing them gold and experience."
29,Twitch,"Caitlyn, Lee Sin, Jinx","Ezreal, Vayne, Sivir","Bottom, Jungle","Marksman, Assassin",Buying a pink ward for lane will deny him from ambushing you.,"Be careful when using Ambush near enemy turrets, as turrets can see invisible units."
30,Karthus,"Kassadin, Katarina, Fizz","Yasuo, Heimerdinger, Vel'Koz",Mid,Mage,Buying a hexdrinker or a Banshee's Veil will greatly increase your chance to survive Requiem.,"Sometimes it can benefit Karthus to die a strategic death, by rushing into a group of enemies and casting Defile the enemy will focus you long enough for your team to initiate without affecting your chance of winning a team fight, as Karthus can cast his spells even after dying."
31,Cho'Gath,"Warwick, Kayle, Jax","Yorick, Malphite, Katarina","Top, Mid, Jungle","Tank, Mage",Dodging his rupture by turning back shortly will let you escape him easily.,"Carnivore allows Cho'Gath to maintain his health and mana, making him a great solo laner. Note, however, that the mana restored is fairly low - it takes about 4 full minion waves to pay for 1 cast of Rupture."
32,Amumu,"Shyvana, Lee Sin, Shaco","Blitzcrank, Yasuo, Katarina",Jungle,Tank,Try not to bunch up against his AOE CC ultimate.,"Cursed Touch reduces magic resistance by up to 25. When going for the kill, make sure you get in at least one melee attack, as many champions only have 30 base magic resistance."
33,Rammus,"Trundle, Vi, Shyvana","Tryndamere, Master Yi, Fiora","Top, Jungle",Tank,"Try not to target him if he has his Defensive Curl on - as he will take much less damage, and he'll also return some damage back to you.",Powerball can be used to interrupt cast dashes such as Jax's Leap Strike or Tristana's Rocket Jump mid-flight.
34,Anivia,"Fizz, Kassadin, Diana","Ryze, Kayle, Lissandra",Mid,Mage,Punish her for missing her stun.,"Anivia's is a combo mage based on landing and combining her skills onto a single enemy. However, 3 of her skills can affect an area of effect, which increases her utility in various situations. Since her kit is focused on a quick combo and a finishing move for one enemy, being a utility combo mage with a great amount of crowd control, she is definitely a mid laner."
35,Shaco,"Lee Sin, Vi, Warwick","Amumu, Master Yi, Maokai",Jungle,Assassin,Always keep an eye out for a puff of smoke in the fog of war - this means Shaco is nearby.,"Backstab is most effective after using Deceive. A guaranteed critical strike with a bonus 20% damage (not a true critical), then quickly followed by a 120% damage Two-Shiv Poison will deal a reasonable amount of damage to any champion's health."
36,Dr. Mundo,"Darius, Olaf, Riven","Jax, Nasus, Amumu",Top,"Tank, Fighter",Ignite significantly lowers Mundo's Health regen from his passive and ultimate.,Dr. Mundo can stay in lane very long since he is manaless and his Adrenaline Rush allows him to constantly regenerate health.
37,Sona,"Blitzcrank, Leona, Thresh","Janna, Lulu, Nunu",Bottom,Support,Do not clump in teamfights in a line - as the Sona will make your whole team dance!,Power Chord has three distinct effects based on the last basic ability Sona used. All of these effects scale with AP.
38,Kassadin,"Talon, Zed, Patheon","Karthus, Katarina, Brand","Mid, Top",Assassin,Kassadin gets completely countered by AD damage early game due to him being melee and having a passive only strong against AP.,"Against enemy mages, Null Sphere is an effective harassment tool that is unblockable by creep waves. The shield can be used to absorb spells sent in retaliation."
39,Irelia,"Olaf, Jax, Renekton","Zed, Jayce, Vladimir",Top,"Fighter, Assassin","Attack speed reduction is extremely strong against Irelia, which lessens the effectiveness of her Hiten Style's active.","Irelia's Ionian Fervor is her staple ability, making it very difficult to lock her down in teamfights and skirmishes with crowd control due to her extended tenacity."
40,Janna,"Sona, Nami, Blitzcrank","Leona, Kennen, Alistar",Bottom,Support,"In lane, if she shields herself, it leaves her carry more open to harassment/being killed.","A quick Howling Gale followed by a Zephyr and an auto-attack while the enemy is in the air is an effectiveharassment method, as it is relatively safe from retaliation due to the amount of CC applied."
41,Gangplank,"Pantheon, Fiora, Irelia","Malzahar, Nasus, Teemo","Top, Bottom","Fighter, Support",Buying early armor against Gangplank is very effective as it will lower the damage from his Parrrley and auto attacks.,Gangplank is an excellent fighter in 1v1 situations due to his high single target damage output and CC removal. Always look for players out of position.
42,Corki,"Caitlyn, Draven, Varus","Jinx, Tristana, Vayne","Bottom, Mid",Marksman,Avoid extended fights because his Gatling gun will tear your armor.,"When cast on a group of enemy minions, Phosphorus Bomb along with Missile Barrage allows Corkito farm extremely fast."
43,Karma,"Veigar, Nami, Malzahar","Morgana, LeBlanc, Leona","Bottom, Mid","Mage, Support","Avoid letting her harass you for free, as it will lower her Mantra's cooldown.","Of her skills, Inner Flame and Soulflare have the lowest mana cost and cooldown, making it easy to reduce Mantra's cooldown faster."
44,Taric,"Sivir, Lulu, Nami","Miss Fortune, Blitzcrank, Draven",Bottom,"Support, Tank","When his stun is down or if he accidentally stuns a minion, punish him hard.",Taric's passive Gemcraft allows him to reduce the cooldown of his abilities by two seconds every time he attacks after using a spell as well as deal additional bonus damage. Try to weave in an autoattack after every spell in order to keep spamming your abilities quickly in succession and maximize damage.
45,Veigar,"Fizz, Ryze, Zed","Karthus, Ahri, Karma",Mid,Mage,Veigar's ultimate deals more damage the more AP you have - so it's good to pick AD champions against a Veigar.,"Veigar's strength as a mage comes from his overall high damage, the zoning potential and CC of his Event Horizon, and mage-killer Primordial Burst. This, combined with his theoretical infinite ability powerstacking, makes him a dangerous opponent as a mage."
48,Trundle,"Sona, Teemo, Jax","Lee Sin, Renekton, Yorick","Top, Jungle",Fighter,"Try your best move him out of his Frozen domain during a fight, as it gives him a massive bonus to his movespeed, attackspeed, and healing.",King's Tribute allows Trundle to jungle effectively as well as keep a sustained presence in lane.
50,Swain,"Viktor, Cassiopeia, Lux","Vladimir, Ahri, Diana","Mid, Top",Mage,Swain excels in teamfights and skirmishes that last for an extended period of time. Avoid this!,"Due to Carrion Renewal offering mana, and Ravenous Flock offering health, Swain can potentially stay in a lane for a very long time. Note that Carrion Renewal cannot hope to offset the massive mana cost of Ravenous Flock, and his ultimate must be used sparingly. Combined with aggressive lane control, it is recommended Swain takes a solo lane to amass gold and experience."
51,Caitlyn,"Sivir, Jinx, Varus","Vayne, Quinn, Graves",Bottom,Marksman,Stay behind minions so her Piltover Peacemaker will do less damage.,Take advantage of Headshot for harassing enemy champions.
53,Blitzcrank,"Leona, Alistar, Morgana","Sona, Kog'Maw, Draven",Bottom,"Tank, Support",Stay behind minions to avoid getting hooked.,"Mana Barrier can be a great source of survivability if itemized for, and its low cooldown ensures it is almost always up for skirmishes."
54,Malphite,"Rumble, Cho'Gath, Vladimir","Jax, Fiora, Pantheon","Jungle, Top",Tank,"If you're an AD champion, avoid getting hit by his Ground Slam, as it will significantly lower your attack speed.","Due to Malphite's Granite Shield, Ground Slam and Unstoppable Force, he is extremely well-suited to a tanking and initiating role."
55,Katarina,"Diana, Malzahar, Fiddlesticks","Karthus, Lux, Nidalee",Mid,Assassin,Save a disable (stun/snare/silence/knock-up/displacement) for her to stop her from channeling her ultimate and dealing massive AOE damage.,Katarina is one of the few manaless champions and is based entirely on cooldowns. Use this to your advantage by using spells whenever possible.
56,Nocturne,"Olaf, Udyr, Vi","Twisted Fate, Kassadin, Darius","Jungle, Top","Tank, Fighter, Assassin","His Duskbringer can be seen in the fog of war, so if you think he is doing objectives such as dragon or baron, look for his Duskbringer particle.",Umbra Blades allows Nocturne to jungle well. Attack speed runes and his Shroud of Darknesssynergize well with Umbra Blades since its cooldown is decreased with every autoattack landed.
57,Maokai,"Shyvana, Nasus, Swain","Riven, Volibear, Darius","Top, Jungle",Tank,Saplings can be outrun if you're fast enough.,"Sap Magic gives him a lot of staying power during the lane phase, especially if facing/laning with champions that spam skills like Evelynn, Akali, Cassiopeia, or Karthus."
58,Renekton,"Garen, Pantheon, Ryze","Jax, Riven, Darius",Top,"Fighter, Tank","Pay attention to Renekton's fury bar, as he will most likely play aggressive when it turns red.","While some might have played manaless champions before, Renekton's Fury resource (shared with Tryndamere and Shyvana) can catch many players who are unfamiliar with Renekton off-guard. While he needs fury to enhance his abilities, he does not need it to cast them. Try to use this to your advantage."
59,Jarvan IV,"Yorick, Shen, Jax","Vladimir, Kayle, Jayce","Jungle, Top","Fighter, Tank",Displacement/dash/jump abilities will let you leap out of his ultimate easily.,"Martial Cadence can only affect a unit once every few seconds, so it is a good idea to target another unit or champion to activate the passive during that time."
60,Elise,"Wukong, Yorick, Mordekaiser","Renekton, Garen, Pantheon","Jungle, Mid",Mage,Stay behind minions so that she won't be able to stun you.,Spider Form is most effective at finishing off enemies with low health; Human Form's Neurotoxindoes more damage to healthy foes.
61,Orianna,"LeBlanc, Syndra, Ahri","Annie, Ryze, Anivia",Mid,Mage,"Try not to stand next to her ball, because she can cast Dissonance and do damage around it.","The ball moves slowly, so calling it back to use Command: Attack is not ideal. Use Command: Attack to position the ball near the enemy and then simply use it again to harass. This way the ball can hit them easily."
62,Wukong,"Lee Sin, Darius, Garen","Zed, Jayce, Teemo",Top,"Tank, Fighter",Avoid clumping up so that Wukong won't be able to use his ultimate to its full potential.,"Wukong can be a decent tank due to his Stone Skin passive as well as being able to dodge abilities with Decoy. Wukong can be a very effective AoE assassin, with Crushing Blow, Nimbus Strike and deals very high damage with a knock-up with Cyclone, though he is even able to covertly dive in and slay any vital carries on the enemy team). Wukong can also be used as the usual bruiser/fighter style, engaging and disengaging with solid damage and solid survivability."
63,Brand,"Kassadin, LeBlanc, Fizz","Annie, Ryze, Lissandra","Mid, Bottom","Mage, Support","Run away from the initial target that Brand uses his ultimate on, as it will bounce to multiple targets.",Deciding what spell to apply Blaze first with is a very important factor when engaging the enemy.
64,Lee Sin,"Trundle, Renekton, Udyr","Wukong, Kha'Zix, Shaco","Jungle, Top","Fighter, Tank",It's usually not worth chasing a Lee Sin because of how mobile his skills make him.,"As it is with most champions, the key to becoming a skilled Lee Sin player is to adapt your strategy to maximize his passive ability. Due to his kit, he is a very versatile mix of both AD Caster and basic attack DPS, being able to inflict damage with a solid mix of attack speed and offensive ability burst."
67,Vayne,"Caitlyn, Draven, Quinn","Lucian, Sivir, Ezreal",Bottom,Marksman,"Try not to stay near walls, as Vayne's Condemn will stun you if it knocks you back against a wall.",For best burst damage try combining the third hit from Silver Bolts and the bonus damage from Tumblein the same attack.
68,Rumble,"Yorick, Xin Zhao, Riven","Nasus, Malphite, Teemo",Top,Mage,Quickly get out of Rumble's ultimate AOE zone as it deals massive damage per second.,"It's important to keep a close eye on your heat gauge whenever casting, with the exception of The Equalizer. All of Rumble's abilities are stronger from 50% heat to 99% heat, but overheating (at 100% heat) will silence you."
69,Cassiopeia,"Galio, LeBlanc, Talon","Ryze, Swain, Mordekaiser",Mid,Mage,Try to turn around when you see her ultimate being cast to avoid being stunned.,Stacking up Aspect of the Serpent is paramount for Cassiopeia.
72,Skarner,"Xin Zhao, Cho'Gath, Olaf","Mordekaiser, Warwick, Vi",Jungle,Fighter,"knock-back/terrain abilities (Janna's Monsoon, Trundle's Pillar of Ice) are strong against Skarner because he will have a hard time trying to pull your allies.","Skarner is a durable, speedy bruiser, excelling at chasing and locking down targets and dealing consistent hybrid damage. His kit best serves him in the jungle, offering fast clear times and effective ganks."
74,Heimerdinger,"Syndra, Ziggs, Lux","Kassadin, Katarina, Diana",Mid,Mage,Killing his turrets first when cast will greatly lower his damage output.,The strength of Heimerdinger lies in his ability to hold lanes safely using his H-28G Evolution Turrets and keep enemies at a distance with the threat of his Hextech Micro-Rockets and CH-1 Concussion Grenade. This along with his deceptive amount of sustained damage can catch enemies unaware.
75,Nasus,"Teemo, Riven, Darius","Jax, Hecarim, Irelia","Top, Jungle","Tank, Fighter","Don't let him free farm, his Q will get stronger in late game.","Constantly last hitting with Siphoning Strike will have an enormous impact by the end of a game, and will be your primary source of damage."
76,Nidalee,"Yasuo, Patheon, Akali","Jayce, Garen, Gnar","Jungle, Mid, Bottom","Support, Mage, Assassin, Fighter","Unless you think you can catch a Nidalee with certainty, don't chase a Nidalee.",Using Javelin Toss just as an enemy minion dies can lead to a surprise hit on an enemy that thought they were safe behind minions and allow follow up attacks in cougar.
77,Udyr,"Ashe, Trundle, Teemo","Lee Sin, Irelia, Patheon","Jungle, Top",Fighter,Pray to gods the enemy Udyr didn't watch Trick2G and his way of playing Udyr (Godyr). If the ememy did Surr@10 even if your team is 40/3.,"It's essential to plan ahead which abilities you will learn with Udyr. Every ability has multiple usages and five levels. The max champion level is 18, limiting one of Udyr's abilities to Tier 3, or two to Tier 4. Typically, a player would choose either Tiger Stance or Phoenix Stance as their main source of damage."
78,Poppy,"Olaf, Darius, Teemo","Gangplank, Jax, Riven",Top,"Fighter, Tank",Avoid diving a Poppy due to her passive making her deceptively tanky.,"Poppy's Valiant Fighter tooltip can be misleading. 50% damage reduction only applies to the portion of damage that actually exceeds 10% of Poppy's current health, not entire damage of that attack."
79,Gragas,"Fizz, Yasuo, Ahri","Lux, Orianna, Katarina","Mid, Jungle",Mage,Gragas's ultimate is extremely strong against grouped up champions - so avoid being clumped together.,"Gragas is a strong solo lane champion, due to his sustain from Happy Hour."
80,Pantheon,"Shen, Darius, Malphite","Gangplank, Teemo, Jax","Top, Jungle","Fighter, Tank",Shoot skillshot spells where hes about to land such as morg bind as it'll stop his movement before he lands and he'll be a free target.,"Pantheon holds the highest movement speed in the game at 355, tied with Master Yi. Use his quick movement speed and strong ranged harass from Spear Shot to whittle your opponents down in lane optimally to take full advantage of his strong early game."
81,Ezreal,"Draven, Graves, Caitlyn","Jinx, Ashe, Lucian","Bottom, Mid","Marksman, Mage",Focus him if he uses his Arcane Shift to enter teamfights.,"Ezreal's strength as a marksman comes from his versatile kit, high mixed damage, and attack speed steroid from Rising Spell Force. His Mystic Shot, Essence Flux, and Arcane Shift have decent range and good utility, encouraging a caster playstyle, and his Trueshot Barrage can deal high burst damage to multiple targets. However, he is very reliant on landing his skillshots for most of his damage output."
82,Mordekaiser,"Garen, Swain, Yorick","Diana, Fizz, Akali","Top, Mid","Tank, Mage",A Quicksilver Sash will get rid of Mordekaiser's ultimate debuff.,"Mordekaiser can make excellent use of his Iron Man shield at all stages of the game. Provided that you have a way to damage an enemy, it can both absorb harassment and give powerful survivability during team fights, letting him stay in the field longer than most other champions. However, keep in mind that spamming skills will result in consistently low health without sufficient health regeneration or spell vamp."
83,Yorick,"Cho'Gath, Trundle, Xin Zhao","Teemo, Darius, Jayce",Top,"Tank, Fighter","If he casts his ultimate on his ally, killing Yorick will also kill the Revenant.","Omen of War resets the attack timer, much like Nasus's Siphoning Strike. For this reason it is better to cast it immediately after an auto-attack for increased damage output."
84,Akali,"Lee Sin, Garen, Mordekaiser","Fizz, Yasuo, Teemo",Mid,Assassin,"After level 6, try to prevent her use of Mark of the Assassin, as she can proc it twice using her dashes.","Beyond rank 1, the Mark of the Assassin debuff lasts longer than the cooldown, allowing Akali to perform a high-damage burst combo by timing her attacks. Specifically, Akali can cast Mark of the Assassin, follow it up with Shadow Dance, then finish with another Mark of the Assassin for extremely high burst damage."
85,Kennen,"Ryze, Janna, Swain","Riven, Olaf, Darius","Top, Mid, Bottom","Mage, Support",Just pick a Ground Pokemon. Everyone knows that Ground Pokemons counter Electric Pokemon!,"Thundering Shuriken can be used to detect enemies hiding in the brush, as a sound effect will play if it impacts a target."
86,Garen,"Teemo, Pantheon, Jayce","Riven, Renekton, Jax",Top,"Fighter, Tank","Avoid staying in lane with low health, as Garen's ultimate will deal massive damage to a lower health target.","Garen's strength as a bruiser comes from his passive, Perseverance and Courage to keep himself healthy along with his decent early damage and utility from Decisive Strike and Judgment, with Demacian Justice providing a reliable and powerful execute."
89,Leona,"Morgana, Alistar, Janna","Blitzcrank, Sona, Varus",Bottom,Support,"If she activates her Eclipse, it means she's about to engage.","Leona is primarily played as a support and her strength as a champion comes from her incredible amount of hard CC from Shield of Daybreak, Zenith Blade, and Solar Flare, the team damage potential from Sunlight, and her natural durability from her stats and Eclipse."
90,Malzahar,"Gangplank, Lux, Galio","Katarina, Yasuo, Vladimir",Mid,Mage,Buying a Quicksilver Sash will let you stop him from suppressing you with his ultimate.,Malzahar can Summon Voidlings by spamming abilities at spawn. This can be useful at beginning of game by using an ability to quickly decimate the jungle monsters or enemy minions in your lane.
91,Talon,"Lee Sin, Diana, Mordekaiser","Kassadin, Lux, Ahri",Mid,Assassin,Talon is very vulnerable when his Cutthroat is on cooldown. Try to take advantage of the situation when it is on cooldown.,"As an AD caster assassin, Talon serves as an anti-mage or anti-carry. Against mages or carries, his high burst damage can easily overwhelm them in one combo."
92,Riven,"Garen, Olaf, Renekton","Nasus, Gnar, Aatrox",Top,Fighter,"Avoid fighting against a Riven in skirmishes, as her raw damage and CC will usually outpower most champions.",Autoattacking in between each Broken Wings allows for the most sustained damage as you consume Runic Blade stacks to deal extra damage.
96,Kog'Maw,"Blitzcrank, Lucian, Jinx","Dr. Mundo, Cho'Gath, Caitlyn","Bottom, Mid",Marksman,"Kog'Maw does not have any escape abilities, making him an easy target. Try to focus him in teamfights first.","Kog'Maw's strength lies in his mixed damage and ability to strike enemies from a distance utilizing his Caustic Spittle and Living Artillery while keeping enemies at bay with his Void Ooze and outright destroying those too close with Bio-Arcane Barrage . However, he has notably short attack range while Bio-Arcane Barrage is on cooldown and suffers from low base stats (apart from mana) and lack of mobility."
98,Shen,"Yorick, Vladimir, Jayce","Pantheon, Malphite, Jarvan IV",Top,Tank,"Shen can be interrupted while channeling his ultimate, preventing him to teleport to his ally. Try laning against him with a champion with a disable.","Getting Vorpal Blade early allows Shen to farm well and stay in the lane/jungle due to its heal. Ki Strike also allows Shen to jungle along with Vorpal Blade without taking too much damage. Because he uses energy instead of mana, the only reason to recall is when his health is low, so keep it high with Vorpal Blade's heal."
99,Lux,"Talon, Fizz, Katarina","Karthus, Ryze, Malzahar","Bottom, Mid","Mage, Support",Lux is very vulnerable once she misses her Light binding.,"Lux's strength as a mage derives from her respectable amount of utility from her Light Binding, Prismatic Barrier, and Lucent Singularity along with her high scaling ratios and damage potential, particularly from her Illumination procs and well known Final Spark. However, she lacks mobility and is vulnerable at close range."
101,Xerath,"Ahri, Fizz, LeBlanc","Ryze, Heimerdinger, Azir",Mid,Mage,Champions that have great gap closing abilities are strong against the long range Xerath.,Xerath has amazing range and is excellent for both strong harass and farm.
102,Shyvana,"Olaf, Teemo, Trundle","Renekton, Amumu, Nautilus","Top, Jungle",Fighter,"Avoid clustering when team fighting against a Shyvana, as Shyvana's abilities become AOE in her ultimate dragon form.","Shyvana's strength comes from her innate durability from Dragonborn and her high mixed damage output, AoE, and utility from Burnout and Dragon's Descent, along with her ability to duel effectively with Flame Breath and Twin Bite. However, she lacks hard CC and is prone to being kited."
103,Ahri,"LeBlanc, Annie, Talon","Xerath, Orianna, Karthus",Mid,Mage,Stay behind minions to prevent yourself from getting charmed.,"Orb of Deception is almost always a first pick on Ahri, as its low cooldown makes it almost an extension of her basic attack."
104,Graves,"Caitlyn, Sivir, Miss Fortune","Ezreal, Varus, Vayne",Bottom,Marksman,"Has low auto attack range, so picking close range AP carries such as Ryze will pressure Graves to not sit in auto attack range durning teamfights.","Try to keep your True Grit stacks up by attacking minions, for free damage mitigation."
105,Fizz,"Ryze, Mordekaiser, Diana","Twisted Fate, Anivia, Syndra","Mid, Jungle","Assassin, Fighter","Buying a Quicksilver Sash and using it will drop the fish from his ultimate, allowing you to avoid the shark.",Remember that Playful can hop over walls making it a good escape mechanism.
106,Volibear,"Teemo, Renekton, Darius","Olaf, Riven, Jax","Jungle, Top","Tank, Fighter",Taking Ignite will cut down Volibear's healing in half.,"Chosen of the Storm is a great way of baiting enemies to overcommit in a fight to kill you. It heals a lot in a fairly short amount of time. However, note that it is less effective against burst damage."
107,Rengar,"Jax, Fiora, Pantheon","Kha'Zix, Yorick, Nasus","Top, Jungle","Fighter, Assassin","Avoid dueling a Rengar when his resource bar is near full, as his skills will become empowered.",Unseen Predator allows you to gank unexpectedly. Use Thrill of the Hunt in order to not be seen across the map as you move towards your gank or save it for chasing if you think the target can escape with Flashand/or stealth or dash ability.
110,Varus,"Graves, Lucian, Tristana","Draven, Caitlyn, Jinx","Bottom, Mid",Marksman,Varus does not have any escape abiltiies. Try to focus him in teamfights.,Using Flash while channeling Piercing Arrow will not interrupt the spell. You can use this to finish off escaping enemies.
111,Nautilus,"Shyvana, Yorick, Udyr","Katarina, Evelynn, Blitzcrank","Top, Bottom","Tank, Support","Nautilus loses his AOE cleave on his auto attacks if you pop his shield, so try to take it down as soon as possible.","If Dredge Line deals the killing blow, it will drag Nautilus to where the target was upon death, as if the skill had hit terrain."
112,Viktor,"Syndra, LeBlanc, Fizz","Swain, Katarina, Rumble",Mid,Mage,"Be careful about chasing a Viktor, because his Gravity field makes it difficult to chase him.","Even by their stat bonuses alone, the Hex Core and its upgrades make for a formidable mage item. They grant Viktor substantial ability power and mana."
113,Sejuani,"Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, Evelynn","Hecarim, Katarina, Darius","Jungle, Top","Tank, Fighter","Knock-back abilities are strong against her, as they will prevent her from initiating fights.","Arctic Assault can be cast through walls, making this ability a great escape and chasing mechanism."
114,Fiora,"Jax, Pantheon, Malphite","Yasuo, Gangplank, Aatrox",Top,Fighter,"Punish her when her Lunge is on cooldown, which is her main mobility skill.","Duelist's regeneration effect stacks up against champions, so don't be afraid to engage in small skirmishes."
115,Ziggs,"LeBlanc, Yasuo, Talon","Ryze, Azir, Heimerdinger",Mid,Mage,"Try to avoid being in the center of Ziggs' ultimate, as it deals more damage in the center.",The increased damage from Short Fuse can be used to better last hit minions or harass an enemy champion.
117,Lulu,"Soraka, Sona, Syndra","Thresh, Katarina, Leona","Bottom, Mid, Top","Mage, Support","Lulu does not have any health sustaining abilities, so try to poke her down in lane.","Lulu is perhaps one of the most versatile champions in the game. Her kit and stats allow her to be played with a multitude of builds, with the most common ones being utility support and ability power carry."
119,Draven,"Varus, Caitlyn, Blitzcrank","Ezreal, Vayne, Jinx",Bottom,Marksman,"Punish Draven for moving to catch axes with a skillshot harass, or CC from a support.","Above all, it is important to remember that while mastering use and catching of Spinning Axe in conjunction with Blood Rush is key to maximizing Draven's damage output, he will still deal carry damage without these skills available. Positioning is the most important goal for any Draven player."
120,Hecarim,"Nasus, Sejuani, Aatrox","Kha'Zix, Ahri, Pantheon","Top, Jungle",Fighter,Avoid being clumped so he won't be able to use his ultimate to fear multiple people.,"Hecarim is a champion with strong defensive stats, good base damage, and average AD ratios, which means he doesn't benefit very much from items that provide raw AD. Because of this, he is most of time played as an off-tank, with armor penetration and Spellblade items as his offensive options."
121,Kha'Zix,"Lee Sin, Rengar, Jayce","Kassadin, Ashe, Yasuo",Jungle,Assassin,"Try not to get yourself isolated, as he deals increased damage to isolated targets.","Kha'Zix is as an AD caster; as such, it is recommended to invest on attack damage, armor penetration, and cooldown reduction, over stats such as attack speed and lifesteal, which doesn't benefit Kha'Zix as much as other champions."
122,Darius,"Teemo, Jayce, Yorick","Wukong, Riven, Nasus",Top,Fighter,"Once his Apprehend is on cooldown, he is incredibly easy to kite.","Crippling Strike resets your autoattack timer, so use it right after a basic attack to add some extra damage. This can be used for pushing towers."
126,Jayce,"Yorick, Irelia, Wukong","Darius, Jax, Teemo","Top, Bottom, Mid","Fighter, Marksman",Keep your distance behind minions to avoid being hit by his long range poke.,"Jayce has a great variety of abilities at his disposal. Judicious use of different combinations grants him excellent flexibility, able to adjust for most situations."
127,Lissandra,"Kassadin, Brand, Anivia","Katarina, Fizz, Zed","Mid, Top",Mage,Try not to stay behind minions to avoid taking splash damage from her Ice Shard harassments.,Iceborn's cooldown will be 17 seconds instead of 18 if the you hit an enemy with Ice Shard.
131,Diana,"Mordekaiser, Riven, Irelia","Katarina, Fizz, Ahri","Top, Mid, Jungle","Assassin, Mage",Dodging her Crescent Strike will lower her damage output significantly after level 6.,"Landing Crescent Strike is important, but don't be afraid to miss. The cooldown is short and the mana cost is low."
133,Quinn,"Caitlyn,Varus, Miss Fortune","Vayne, Jinx, Draven",Top,"Marksman, Assassin","Try to stay away from her when you're marked with Harrier, as she will do additional damage to you.",Enemies marked by Harrier are visible in the brush until you trigger the passive or it expires.
134,Syndra,"Fizz, Talon, Lux","Heimerdinger, Orianna, LeBlanc","Mid, Bottom","Mage, Support",Syndra is vulnerable after she uses her Scatter the Weak. Try to play aggressive while it's down.,"For a basic combo,launch a sphere,wait for the next sphere,grab and get close,throw it,launch other sphere right in the enemie's spot and then use Scatter the Weak.If it is right,you can get a fast burst combo,enough to kill a squishy without your ultimate."
143,Zyra,"Katarina, Fizz, Akali","Mordekaiser, Braum, Thresh","Bottom, Mid","Support, Mage",Zyra's seeds can be crushed by stepping on them.,Zyra's main combo is Grasping Roots > Rampant Growth if you see the roots about to land > Rampant Growth > Deadly Bloom.
150,Gnar,"Riven, Irelia, Pantheon","Jax, Nasus, Garen",Top,Fighter,"ALWAYS keep an eye on his rage bar. If you aren't careful, he can hop on a minion and transform on you dealing massive burst damage. However, going in on him when his rage bar is nearly empty can be devastating to him (best time to gank him).",Boomerang Throw can be buy time to Hop over a wall thanks to its AOE slow. It can be thrown in front of you instead of directly at enemies in order to prevent the boomerang from reversing direction too quickly.
154,Zac,"Vi, Zilean, Renekton","Malphite, Jax, Katarina","Top, Jungle","Tank, Fighter","Zac's goos can be crushed by stepping on them, denying him health regeneration.","Although all of Zac's abilities cost 4% of his current health, the cost is always compensated by picking up the blobs from Cell Division."
157,Yasuo,"Jax, Riven, Fiora","Vel'Koz, Nidalee, Lux","Mid, Top","Assassin, Fighter","Yasuo's shield from Resolve lasts only 2 seconds. Dealing damage to him will trigger it. Wait it out, then engage.","Intent doubles your total Critical Strike chance, giving Yasuo an advantage during the late game."
161,Vel'Koz,"Yasuo, LeBlanc, Fizz","Heimerdinger, Teemo, Ryze",Mid,Mage,Vel'Koz has a kit consisting of 4 skillshots making him very vulnerable to champions with dashes.,"Plasma Fission has decent base damage, a low mana cost, and short cooldown, making it his main poke/harass tool."
201,Braum,"Morgana, Zyra, Lulu","Caitlyn, Blitzcrank, Miss Fortune",Bottom,"Tank, Support","Braum must land Winter's Bite or a basic attack to start Concussive Blows. If you get marked, exit combat range before getting hit 3 more times to avoid the stun.","Braum's abilities work best with allies, and as such, he should often be in a duo lane."
222,Jinx,"Ezreal, Corki, Sivir","Caitlyn, Twitch, Ashe",Bottom,Marksman,"Her base auto attack range is low in minigun stance, which makes her easier to harass.","Jinx's strength as a marksman comes from her high scaling damage and ratios, ability to kite well with Flame Chompers! and Zap!, being able to finish off enemies with Super Mega Death Rocket!, and ability to continue the carnage (or disengage promptly) with Get Excited!."
236,Lucian,"Vayne, Draven, Ezreal","Varus, Jinx, Caitlyn",Bottom,Marksman,"His ult can be used while he's moving, so watch out as he may try to kite you.","Autoattacking between your skills, proccing Lightslinger, is an efficient way to boost your damage and also reduce the cooldown of Relentless Pursuit."
238,Zed,"Kayle, Lissandra, Irelia","Kassadin, Lux, Teemo",Mid,Assassin,Quicksilver Sash will take off Zed's ultimate immediately.,Saving energy and spell cooldowns until you use your ultimate will potentially maximize Death Mark'sdamage.
254,Vi,"Jax, Riven, Darius","Zac, Katarina, Jarvan IV",Jungle,"Tank, Fighter","Vi's Vault Break can be interrupted while charging, so try to save a disable",A fully-charged Vault Breaker will deal twice as much damage as an uncharged one. It's great for catching and finishing off fleeing enemies.

267,Nami,"Lulu, Ezreal, Leona","Draven, Thresh, Taric",Bottom,Support,"Nami's ultimate is very long, but it travels slowly. Try your best to get out of the way of the waves.","Nami has very high potential in ganking. Her passive Surging Tides gives bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds, which is enough for a teammate to catch up to an opposing enemy."
268,Azir,"Ziggs, Zed, Ahri","Yasuo, Katarina, Nasus",Mid,Mage,"Azirs are forced to start with their W first. At level 1, their soldiers are very immobile, and so is Azir. At level 2, he'll probably take his Q. He shouldn't have escapes until level 3. Get an early gank to try to snowball lane.","Azir's Conquering Sands will move his soldiers relative to when the soldiers were placed. The soldier placed first will move to the location of Azir's cursor at the time conquering sands was cast. The second soldier placed will move to the right of Azir's cursor, and the last soldier placed will move to the right of where Azir's cursor was. Their movements do not depend on how close they are to the target."
412,Thresh,"Lulu, Alistar, Morgana","Blitzcrank, Draven, Leona",Bottom,Support,disable (silence/stun/knock-up) or standing on the lantern will prevent the enemy from clicking on the lantern.,"While Damnation allows Thresh to continually gain power, he starts off weak. Be cautious early game."
421,Rek'Sai,"Fizz, Gangplank, Darius","Evelynn, Rengar, Shaco","Jungle, Top","Fighter, Tank","Destroy any of her tunnels you find; this will give her less map presence, as well as anyone with teleport.","As Rek'Sai is most effective in the jungle, picking the right jungle item enchantment is one of your most important decisions."
429,Kalista,"Ashe, Caitlyn, Vayne","Ezreal, Thresh, Jinx",Bottom,Marksman,lane bullies are extremely effective against the squishy Kalista.Caitlyn is best casue she out ranges her and can poke her down from afar. Kalista has unlimited wards with her W so junglers should focus other lanes to gank.,Attack speed and Martial Poise will make it possible to Kalista to move faster while attack-dashing than when just running
432,Bard,"Morgana, Teemo, Blitzcrank","Urgot, Yorick, Fiddlesticks",Bottom,Support,"Dont stay in group of minions ,so he can't stun you.",Cosmic Binding can stun an enemy champion hiding behind a minion.
